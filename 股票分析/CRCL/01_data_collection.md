## 2. Market Data Snapshot (February 21, 2026)

### 2.1 Price & Valuation

| Metric | Value | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stock Price | ~$63.02 | Yahoo Finance | Intraday |
| Market Capitalization | ~$14.84B | Yahoo Finance | Based on diluted shares |
| Enterprise Value | ~$13.65B | Stock Analysis | EV = MCap + Debt - Cash |
| Forward P/E | 63.67 | Yahoo Finance | Based on FY2026E consensus |
| TTM P/E | N/M (negative) | Calculated | TTM EPS is -$1.79 due to SBC |
| P/S (TTM) | ~7.5x | Calculated | MCap / TTM Revenue ~$1,977M |
| EV/Revenue (FY2025E) | ~5.8x | Calculated | $13.65B / $2,345M midpoint |
| EV/Adj EBITDA (FY2025E) | ~43.7x | Calculated | $13.65B / $312M midpoint |

> **ANOMALY FLAG:** The TTM EPS of -$1.79 is misleading. Q2 2025 included a one-time $591M stock-based compensation (SBC) charge related to the IPO (RSU vesting upon listing). Excluding this charge, the underlying business is profitable. See Section 5 for adjusted metrics.

### 2.2 Share Structure

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Shares Outstanding (Total) | 235.48M |
| Class A Shares | 216.49M (publicly traded) |
| Class B Shares | ~18.99M (supervoting, held by insiders) |
| Float | ~196M (estimated) |
| Dual-Class Structure | Yes - Class B carries 5x voting rights |

### 2.3 Trading Data

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| 52-Week High | $298.99 |
| 52-Week Low | $49.90 |
| Current vs. 52W High | -78.9% |
| Current vs. 52W Low | +26.3% |
| Beta | 0.98 |
| Average Volume (3M) | ~3.2M shares/day |

> **ANOMALY FLAG:** The $298.99 high was likely set during the initial IPO trading frenzy (June 2025). The stock has since corrected significantly to more fundamental levels. The current price of ~$63 represents a 79% decline from peak, which is not unusual for high-profile tech/fintech IPOs that experience initial euphoria.

## 3. Income Statement Data

### 3.1 Quarterly Revenue Trend

| Quarter | Revenue ($M) | YoY Growth | QoQ Growth | Reserve Income ($M) | Other Revenue ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 2024 | $365 | - | - | ~$362 | ~$3 |
| Q2 2024 | $430 | - | +17.8% | ~$426 | ~$4 |
| Q3 2024 | $446 | - | +3.7% | ~$440 | ~$6 |
| Q4 2024 | ~$435 | - | -2.5% | ~$432 | ~$3 |
| **FY2024** | **$1,676** | **+15.6%** | - | **~$1,660** | **~$16** |
| Q1 2025 | $579 | +58.5% | +33.1% | ~$560 | ~$19 |
| Q2 2025 | $658 | +53.0% | +13.6% | ~$635 | ~$23 |
| Q3 2025 | $740 | +65.9% | +12.5% | $711 | $29 |

**Key Observations:**
- Revenue acceleration throughout 2025 driven by USDC circulation growth (+108% YoY)
- Reserve income remains the dominant revenue source (~96%)
- Other revenue (transaction fees, CPN, platform services) growing from a small base but showing strong sequential momentum ($3M -> $29M quarterly)
- QoQ deceleration from Q1 2025 (+33.1%) to Q3 2025 (+12.5%) but YoY acceleration (58.5% -> 65.9%) due to favorable base effects

### 3.2 Q3 2025 Income Statement Detail (Most Recent Quarter)

| Line Item | Q3 2025 ($M) | Q3 2024 ($M) | YoY Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Revenue** | **$740** | **$446** | **+65.9%** |
| Reserve Income | $711 | $428 (est.) | +66.1% |
| Other Revenue | $29 | $18 (est.) | +61.1% |
| Distribution & Transaction Costs | ($448) | ($257) (est.) | +74.3% |
| **Gross Profit** | **$292** | **$189** (est.) | **+54.5%** |
| Gross Margin | 39.5% | 42.4% | -290 bps |
| Operating Expenses (GAAP) | ($211) | ($124) (est.) | +70.2% |
| Adjusted Operating Expenses | ($131) | ($97) (est.) | +35.1% |
| **Net Income** | **$214** | **$71** (est.) | **+201.4%** |
| **Adjusted EBITDA** | **$166** | **$93** (est.) | **+78.5%** |
| Adj EBITDA Margin | 22.4% | 20.9% | +150 bps |
| Adj EBITDA / Gross Profit | 56.8% | 49.2% | +760 bps |

> **DATA NOTE:** The GAAP OpEx of $211M vs Adjusted OpEx of $131M implies ~$80M in SBC and other adjustments in Q3 2025 alone (ongoing, not the one-time IPO charge). The gap between GAAP and Adjusted is significant and warrants monitoring.

### 3.3 FY2024 Full Year Income Statement

| Line Item | FY2024 ($M) | FY2023 ($M) | YoY Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Revenue** | **$1,676** | **$1,450** (est.) | **+15.6%** |
| Reserve Income | ~$1,660 | ~$1,430 | +16.1% |
| Other Revenue | ~$16 | ~$20 | -20.0% |
| Distribution & Transaction Costs | ~($1,010) | ~($830) | +21.7% |
| Cost to Coinbase | ~($908) | ~($725) (est.) | +25.2% |
| **Gross Profit** | **$395** (est.) | **$350** (est.) | **+12.9%** |
| Gross Margin | 23.6% | 24.1% | -50 bps |
| **Operating Income** | **$167** | **$144** (est.) | **+16.0%** |
| Operating Margin | 9.97% | 9.9% | +7 bps |
| **Net Income** | **$156** | **$129** (est.) | **+20.9%** |
| Net Margin | 9.3% | 8.9% | +40 bps |
| **Adjusted EBITDA** | **$285** | **$228** (est.) | **+25.0%** |

### 3.4 Profitability Adjustments & SBC Impact

| Metric | TTM (Reported) | TTM (Adjusted ex-IPO SBC) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| TTM Net Income | -$421M (est.) | +$170M (est.) | Add back $591M IPO SBC |
| TTM EPS | -$1.79 | +$0.72 (est.) | Normalized |
| Q2 2025 SBC Charge | $591M | One-time | RSU vesting upon IPO |
| Ongoing Quarterly SBC | ~$80M | Recurring | Q3 2025 GAAP vs Adj gap |

> **CRITICAL ANOMALY:** The TTM EPS of -$1.79 and negative TTM net income are entirely artifacts of the Q2 2025 IPO-related SBC charge of $591M. This is a non-cash, one-time event. The underlying business generated ~$214M net income in Q3 2025 alone. Any valuation model using TTM GAAP earnings will produce meaningless results. Use adjusted metrics or forward estimates instead.

## 4. Balance Sheet Data (Q3 2025)

| Line Item | Value ($M) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Total Assets** | **$76,780** | Dominated by USDC reserves |
| USDC Reserve Assets | ~$73,700 | US Treasuries + Cash in BlackRock fund |
| Cash & Equivalents (Corporate) | $1,350 | Excludes USDC reserves |
| Other Assets | ~$1,730 | Goodwill, intangibles, receivables |
| **Total Liabilities** | **$73,760** | Dominated by USDC obligations |
| USDC Obligations | ~$73,700 | 1:1 match with reserves |
| Total Debt | $164 | Minimal leverage |
| Other Liabilities | ~$60 (est.) | AP, accrued expenses |
| **Shareholders' Equity** | **$3,020** | |
| **Net Cash Position** | **$1,186** | Cash $1,350 - Debt $164 |
| **Working Capital** | **$2,200** | |

**Key Observations:**
- The balance sheet is dominated by the USDC reserve pass-through: $73.7B in reserve assets matched by $73.7B in USDC obligations. These net to approximately zero economic value to equity holders.
- The "real" balance sheet is approximately: $3.0B equity, $1.35B corporate cash, $164M debt.
- Net cash of $1.18B provides a strong liquidity cushion.
- Debt-to-equity ratio is negligible (0.054x).

## 5. Operating Metrics (USDC Ecosystem)

| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | YoY Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| USDC in Circulation | $73.7B | $35.4B (est.) | +108.2% |
| USDC Market Share (stablecoins) | 29% | 23% | +600 bps |
| On-chain Transaction Volume | $9.6T | $1.4T (est.) | +585.7% (6.8x) |
| Meaningful Wallets (>$10 USDC) | 6.3M | 3.6M (est.) | +77.1% |
| USDC Velocity (Ann. Volume / Circ.) | ~130x | ~40x (est.) | Significant increase |

**Key Observations:**
- USDC circulation growth of 108% YoY is the primary driver of revenue growth (reserve income = interest rate x circulation).
- Market share gains from 23% to 29% indicate competitive momentum despite Tether's dominance.
- On-chain volume growth (6.8x) dramatically outpaces circulation growth (2.1x), indicating increasing USDC velocity and utility.
- Meaningful wallet growth of 77% signals genuine user adoption, not just institutional/whale accumulation.

## 6. Cash Flow Data

| Metric | FY2024 ($M) | TTM (est.) ($M) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operating Cash Flow | ~$400 | ~$450 (est.) | Excludes reserve changes |
| Capital Expenditures | ~($21) | ~($25) (est.) | Asset-light model |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **~$379** | **~$425** (est.) | Strong FCF generation |
| FCF Margin | ~22.6% | ~21.5% (est.) | |
| FCF Yield | ~2.6% | ~2.9% (est.) | FCF / Market Cap |

> **DATA NOTE:** Cash flow from operations can appear extremely volatile due to changes in USDC reserve assets (billions in movement). The figures above attempt to isolate corporate cash generation from the reserve pass-through. Verify against 10-K/10-Q cash flow statements for precision.

## 7. FY2025 Management Guidance

| Metric | FY2025 Guidance Range | Midpoint | Implied H2 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total Revenue | $2,335 - $2,355M | $2,345M | ~$1,108M (Q3+Q4) |
| Other Revenue | $90 - $100M | $95M | ~$48M (Q3+Q4) |
| Adjusted OpEx | $495 - $510M | $502.5M | ~$262M (Q3+Q4) |
| Adjusted EBITDA | $307 - $317M (est.) | $312M | ~$166M+ (Q3+Q4) |

**Guidance Check vs. Actuals:**
- Q1-Q3 2025 Revenue: $579 + $658 + $740 = $1,977M
- Implied Q4 2025 Revenue: $2,345M - $1,977M = ~$368M

> **ANOMALY FLAG:** The implied Q4 2025 revenue of ~$368M would represent a massive sequential decline from Q3's $740M (-50.3% QoQ). This seems inconsistent with the USDC circulation trajectory. Possible explanations:
> 1. **Interest rate cuts**: If the Fed cut rates significantly in late 2025, reserve income would decline.
> 2. **Conservative guidance**: Management may have provided guidance early in the year when Fed path was uncertain.
> 3. **Data interpretation error**: The guidance range may need to be re-verified against the most recent earnings call transcript.
>
> **ACTION REQUIRED:** Cross-reference this guidance with the Q3 2025 earnings call transcript and any guidance updates. If rates stayed stable, actual Q4 revenue should significantly exceed the implied ~$368M.

## 8. Revenue Composition Analysis

### 8.1 Revenue Dependency on Interest Rates

| Scenario | Fed Funds Rate | Est. Reserve Yield | Est. Annual Reserve Income (at $75B circ.) | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current (Q3 2025) | 4.50-4.75% (est.) | ~3.85% | ~$2,888M | Baseline |
| 100 bps cut | 3.50-3.75% | ~2.85% | ~$2,138M | -$750M (-26%) |
| 200 bps cut | 2.50-2.75% | ~1.85% | ~$1,388M | -$1,500M (-52%) |
| 300 bps cut | 1.50-1.75% | ~0.85% | ~$638M | -$2,250M (-78%) |

> **CRITICAL NOTE:** Reserve income is the product of (USDC Circulation) x (Reserve Yield). Circle is simultaneously long circulation growth and long interest rates. In a rate-cutting environment, circulation growth must outpace yield compression to maintain revenue growth. This is the single most important variable for the investment thesis.

### 8.2 Distribution Cost Structure

| Cost Component | FY2024 ($M) | % of Revenue | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coinbase Revenue Share | ~$908 | 54.2% | Largest single cost |
| Other Distribution Costs | ~$102 | 6.1% | Exchange partners, infrastructure |
| **Total Distribution & Transaction** | **~$1,010** | **60.3%** | |

## 9. Analyst Estimates (Consensus)

| Metric | FY2025E | FY2026E | FY2027E |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $2,345M | $2,800-3,200M (est.) | $3,500-4,200M (est.) |
| Adj EPS | $0.99 (est.) | $1.25-1.50 (est.) | $1.80-2.20 (est.) |
| Adj EBITDA | $312M | $400-500M (est.) | $550-750M (est.) |

> **DATA NOTE:** Analyst coverage for CRCL is still building post-IPO. Consensus estimates have wide dispersion reflecting uncertainty about interest rate paths, USDC growth rates, and the Coinbase revenue share renegotiation.

## 11. Anomaly Summary

| # | Anomaly | Severity | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TTM EPS = -$1.79 | HIGH | Q2 2025 $591M one-time IPO SBC charge. Exclude for normalized valuation. |
| 2 | 52W High of $298.99 | MEDIUM | IPO euphoria pricing. Current ~$63 is a -79% drawdown. Not necessarily a bargain - the IPO price was irrational. |
| 3 | Implied Q4 guidance ~$368M | HIGH | Massive sequential decline from $740M. Likely stale/conservative guidance or rate cut impact. Verify. |
| 4 | GAAP vs. Adj OpEx gap ~$80M/qtr | MEDIUM | Ongoing SBC expense (not just IPO one-time). ~$320M/yr in SBC is significant dilution. |
| 5 | Distribution costs growing faster than revenue | MEDIUM | +74% YoY vs. revenue +66% YoY in Q3. Coinbase share may be consuming incremental margin. |
| 6 | Total Assets $76.78B vs. Equity $3.02B | LOW | Expected - USDC reserves are pass-through. Not indicative of leverage risk. |
